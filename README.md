# DC-Gan-with-tensorflow
Deep Convolutional Generative Network (DCGAN)is one of the most popular also the most successful implementation of GAN. It is composed of ConvNets in place of multi-layer perceptrons. The ConvNets are implemented without max pooling, which is in fact replaced by convolutional stride. Also, the layers are not fully connected
